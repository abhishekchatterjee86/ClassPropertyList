# ClassPropertyList

How can I get a list (in the form of an NSArray or NSDictionary) of a given object attributes in Objective-C?

Imagine the following scenario: I have defined a parent class which just extends NSObject, that holds an NSString, a BOOL and an NSData object as attributes. Then I have several classes which extend this parent class, adding a lot of different attributes each.
